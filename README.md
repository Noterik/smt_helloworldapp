Helloworld p app
====================

One of the examples we provide with the toolkit probably the first you will try or copy to get started

1) Check out smt_helloworldapp in Eclipse
2) Build a war using the 'deploy-war' task with the provided build.xml
3) Do not deploy it in tomcat!, we use the war format but it should be loaded in Lou so use the application manager
